## About Me

Curiosity has driven me for as long as I can remember, with science and art holding equal weight in my life. That passion led me to complete my bachelor‚Äôs degree in pre-medicine and classical violin at Duquesne University in 2021. Through both the precision of science and the beauty of music, I came to see the human body as the most extraordinary work of art.

My path to medicine was solidified after nearly losing my life in a car accident. I fell asleep at the wheel after months of pushing my limits - minimal sleep and overworked. Modern medicine saved my life, and I am forever grateful. While healing from a traumatic brain injury, relearning to walk, and completing my degree, I began to reflect on what I wanted from life.

I realized that while conventional medicine excels at preserving life and extending lifespan, I wanted more. I wanted to not only live long, but to live fully. To me this meant To keep my mind sharp, body resilient, relationships close. I learned that discipline and grit could get me far, but balance and rest were essential to truly optimize my health and reach my goals. That kind of healing required looking beyond ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù and asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs possible?‚Äù

When I later took up bodybuilding, I saw both ends of the spectrum: doctors who dismissed my goals, and coaches who pushed results at the expense of long-term health. I knew there was a better way. If someone has a goal, they will pursue it, and my role as a doctor is to guide them in a way that maximizes performance, supports health, and protects longevity.

I went on to earn my Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree from the National Universtiy of Natural Medicine in 2025. 

Today, my practice is shaped by the principles of Medicine 3.0‚Äîfocusing on both lifespan and healthspan, the years lived in optimal health. My approach is collaborative, highly personalized, and grounded in evidence-informed medicine. My mission is simple: not just to treat what's wrong, but to help you discover what's possible.
