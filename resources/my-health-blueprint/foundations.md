## Foundations of Health

Before diving into advanced optimization strategies, it's crucial to master the fundamentals. These four pillars form the foundation upon which all other health interventions build. Without a solid foundation, even the most sophisticated protocols will fall short.

## The Sleep Foundation

**Why Sleep Comes First:** Poor sleep undermines every other health intervention. You cannot out-supplement or out-exercise chronic sleep deprivation.

### Key Sleep Metrics:
- **Duration:** 7-9 hours for most adults
- **Timing:** Consistent sleep and wake times
- **Quality:** Deep sleep and REM cycles
- **Environment:** Cool, dark, and quiet

### Quick Wins:
1. **Consistent bedtime routine** - Start winding down 1-2 hours before sleep
2. **Light management** - Bright light in the morning, dim light in the evening
3. **Temperature optimization** - Keep bedroom between 65-68¬∞F
4. **Limit stimulants** - No caffeine after 2 PM

## Nutrition Fundamentals

**Food as Medicine:** Every meal is an opportunity to support or sabotage your health goals.

### Core Principles:
- **Protein priority:** 0.8-1.2g per kg body weight minimum
- **Vegetable volume:** Half your plate at each meal
- **Healthy fats:** Essential for hormone production and absorption
- **Timing matters:** Eating windows and meal frequency

### The 80/20 Rule:
Focus on getting 80% of your nutrition from whole, unprocessed foods. The remaining 20% allows for flexibility and social enjoyment without guilt.

### Quick Assessment:
- Are you eating protein at every meal?
- Do you include vegetables at lunch and dinner?
- Are you staying hydrated (half your body weight in ounces of water)?
- Do you feel satisfied and energized after meals?

## Movement as Medicine

**Beyond Exercise:** Movement is about more than structured workouts‚Äîit's about how you move throughout the day.

### Essential Movement Categories:
1. **Strength Training** - 2-3x per week, all major muscle groups
2. **Cardiovascular Exercise** - Mix of steady-state and high-intensity
3. **Mobility & Flexibility** - Daily movement and weekly dedicated sessions
4. **Daily Movement** - Walking, standing, and general activity

### The Minimum Effective Dose:
- **150 minutes moderate aerobic activity** per week
- **2 strength training sessions** per week
- **Daily walking** - aim for 8,000-10,000 steps
- **Movement breaks** every 30-60 minutes if sedentary

## Stress Management & Recovery

**Stress isn't the problem‚Äîlack of recovery is.** Acute stress can be beneficial, but chronic stress without adequate recovery is devastating to health.

### Types of Stress:
- **Physical stress:** Exercise, illness, environmental toxins
- **Mental/emotional stress:** Work, relationships, financial pressure
- **Chemical stress:** Poor nutrition, medications, toxins

### Recovery Strategies:
1. **Breathing practices** - 5-10 minutes daily
2. **Nature exposure** - Time outdoors, even brief
3. **Social connection** - Quality relationships and community
4. **Mindfulness practices** - Meditation, gratitude, presence

### Stress Assessment Questions:
- Do you feel rested upon waking?
- Can you fall asleep within 20 minutes?
- Do you feel overwhelmed more often than calm?
- Are you getting sick frequently?

### Week 3-4: Nutrition Basics
Add proper nutrition fundamentals while maintaining good sleep habits.

### Week 5-6: Movement Integration
Incorporate regular movement while maintaining sleep and nutrition improvements.

### Week 7-8: Stress Management
