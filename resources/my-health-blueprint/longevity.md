## The Science of Aging

**Aging is not inevitable‚Äîit's a collection of cellular processes that can be influenced.** Understanding the mechanisms of aging allows us to target interventions that slow the aging process and extend healthspan.

### The Hallmarks of Aging:

#### Primary Hallmarks (Causes):
- **Genomic instability:** DNA damage accumulation
- **Telomere attrition:** Shortening of chromosome protective caps
- **Epigenetic alterations:** Changes in gene expression patterns
- **Loss of proteostasis:** Protein quality control decline

#### Antagonistic Hallmarks (Responses):
- **Deregulated nutrient sensing:** Metabolic pathway dysfunction
- **Mitochondrial dysfunction:** Cellular energy production decline
- **Cellular senescence:** Cells stop dividing, become inflammatory
- **Stem cell exhaustion:** Reduced regenerative capacity

#### Integrative Hallmarks (Effects):
- **Altered intercellular communication:** Inflammation, immune dysfunction
- **Chronic inflammation:** "Inflammaging"
- **Dysbiosis:** Microbiome changes with age

### Targeting Aging Mechanisms:
- **Caloric restriction mimetics:** Activate longevity pathways
- **Exercise:** Stimulates cellular repair and regeneration
- **Stress hormesis:** Controlled stress that builds resilience
- **Sleep optimization:** Essential for cellular repair
- **Social connection:** Impacts longevity through multiple pathways
