## Hello There!

Welcome to my website. This is a simple landing page built with **11ty (Eleventy)**, a fantastic static site generator that makes building websites easy and fun.

This page demonstrates how easy it is to write content in **Markdown** instead of HTML. You can focus on your content without worrying about HTML tags!

### What's Next?

Here are some things you can do:

- **Customize** the content and styling
- **Add more pages** (just create new `.md` files!)
- **Include** your projects or portfolio
- **Add** contact information
- **Create** blog posts

### Why Markdown is Great

1. **Simple syntax** - much easier than HTML
2. **Focus on content** - not formatting
3. **Still flexible** - you can add HTML when needed
4. **Readable** - even in its raw form
