## My Approach to Medicine

Medicine 3.0 focuses on both lifespan and healthspan—the years lived in optimal health. My approach is collaborative, highly personalized, and grounded in evidence-informed medicine. My mission is simple: not just to treat what's wrong, but to help you discover what's possible.
