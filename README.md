To build your site:
```shell
make publish
```

This will take your Markdown and produce HTML in the directory `/Users/sophiekwin/Documents/sophie-website`, 
add those files to git and push them to the branch `gh-pages`. This will then be reflected on the 
domain name you have set up in github within 5 minutes or so.
